# Medical transcripts Project

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
-  Medical data is extremely hard to find due to HIPAA privacy regulations. This data was scraped from mtsamples.com
and  contains sample medical transcriptions for various medical specialties.



## GOALS 


- Predict the medical specialties based on the transcription text  using property data that was  scraped from mtsamples.com.

## PROJECT PLANNIG



### Acquire
- Acquire data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/tboyle10/medicaltranscriptions) 
### Prepare
- Clean and prepare data for preparation step. 
Split dataset into train, validate, test. Separate target from features and scale the selected features. Create a function to automate the process. The function is saved in a prepare.py module. 
### Explore
- Visualize all combinations of variables.Define two hypotheses, set an alpha, run the statistical tests needed, document findings and takeaways.
### Model
- Extablishing and evaluating a baseline model.
- Document various algorithms and/or hyperparameters you tried along with the evaluation code and results.
- Evaluate the  models using the standard techniques: computing the evaluation metrics 
- Choose the model that performs the best.
- Evaluate the best model (only one) on the test dataset.
